# INSTRUCT
Two-dimensional plane frame analysis.

GUI for data entry and results preview.
Input can be either GUI-interactive or using an input data file.
Data entered interactively are saved as an editable input data file. 

Analysis results are previewed on-screen within the program, and are saved, neatly formatted, tabulated and paged, in .RTF files.  The .RTF results files can then be opened and edited by M$Word, and/or imported into M$Word report documents.

A structural diagram is generated on-screen and in the .RTF results file.

The program is written in Fortran, and it uses the sublime DISLIN library for the GUI.
Pull-down help menus explain at each stage how to use the program.  The equation solver uses the most-highly-optimised  skyline storage method for member stiffnesses.
